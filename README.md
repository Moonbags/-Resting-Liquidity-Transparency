# Resting Liquidity Transparency
Hey, I’m [Moonbags], and I’m fed up with DeFi’s hidden liquidity—like Drift’s JIT model. My fix? **DROC**: on-chain, collateral-backed orders (0.01 SOL or JitoSOL) you can actually see. Plus a **Resting Liquidity Vault** where users toss in assets, boost liquidity, and earn DRIFT or $JTO. 

- `docs/proposal.md`: The big picture—mechanics, rewards, why it’s better.
- `contracts/`: Code for DROC, vault, rewards—dig in!
- `tests/`: Backtest results showing it works in bull/bear markets.

Feedback, collabs, whatever—hit me up on X (@[SHA 256) or Moonbags @Discord
Here’s an overview of the code and functionality in the Moonbags/-Resting-Liquidity-Transparency repository:

**Purpose & Main Features:**
- The project is called DROC, aiming to solve transparency issues in DeFi liquidity, especially with models like Drift’s JIT.
- It introduces “on-chain, collateral-backed orders” (using 0.01 SOL or JitoSOL) that are visible to everyone.
- A “Resting Liquidity Vault” allows users to deposit assets, which boosts market liquidity and earns rewards (DRIFT or $JTO).

**Code Structure:**
- **docs/proposal.md**: Contains the overall mechanics, reward structure, and reasoning for the system—explains the “big picture.”
- **contracts/**: Includes code for the DROC protocol, the liquidity vault, and reward distribution logic.
- **tests/**: Shows backtest results for the system’s performance in bull and bear markets.

**Functionality:**
- Users deposit assets into the vault to provide visible, resting liquidity.
- Orders are backed by collateral and managed on-chain for full transparency.
- Participants can earn rewards for contributing liquidity.
- The system is designed to be auditable and open, countering opaque liquidity practices.
