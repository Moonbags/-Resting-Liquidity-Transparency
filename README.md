Certainly! Here’s a universal, copy-paste-ready README for your Resting Liquidity Transparency (DROC) project, designed to work with any protocol, not just Drift. It highlights cross-protocol support and composability, with sections you can further customize for specific integrations or assets.

Resting Liquidity Transparency
Decentralized Resting Order Commitments (DROC) & Resting Liquidity Vault

Overview
Resting Liquidity Transparency aims to bring visible, on-chain resting orders to any decentralized trading protocol. Many protocols—especially those using distributed limit order books (DLOBs) and just-in-time (JIT) liquidity—struggle to provide takers with transparent market depth, reducing trust and trading volume compared to centralized exchanges.
DROC is a cross-protocol solution for any DEX, perpetuals exchange, or DeFi platform seeking visible, time-bound, collateral-backed orders and user-driven liquidity vaults.

Problem Statement: The Resting Liquidity Visibility Issue
Visible resting liquidity is essential for market confidence. Traditional centralized exchanges display orderbook depth, but decentralized protocols often lack transparent, time-bound resting orders—resulting in:

Taker uncertainty: Participants fear slippage and poor execution.
Lower trading volume: Users accustomed to CEX orderbooks are deterred.
Competitive pressure: Protocols must match CEX-like liquidity to grow.
The DROC Solution
Decentralized Resting Order Commitments (DROC):

On-chain, collateral-backed orders with user-selected price, size, duration, and optional JIT confirmation.
Orders validated against reliable oracles (e.g., Pyth, Switchboard).
Aggregated and displayed in a CLOB-like interface for any protocol.
Time-bound commitments with visible expiration and fill probability.
Resting Liquidity Vault:

Users deposit assets (SOL, JitoSOL, USDC, etc.) to fund DROC orders and boost liquidity.
UI for managing vault contributions and viewing impact on orderbook.
Supports protocol-native and yield-generating assets (e.g., JitoSOL).
Operates independently from delta-neutral or market-making vaults.
Key Mechanics
Order Submission: Makers specify price, size, duration, and collateral. Orders are validated and locked.
Orderbook Display: DROC orders are shown in a protocol’s orderbook UI, including expiration timers and fill metrics.
Execution: Takers match DROC orders, triggering optional JIT confirmation for maker protection.
Expiration & Pruning: Orders expire, and collateral is refunded via permissionless cranks.
Reward Model: Makers earn protocol-native or external rewards based on the duration and tightness of their orders.
Sample Reward Formula:
reward = base_reward × duration × (1 - spread / oracle_price)

Benefits
Takers: Gain CEX-like confidence and reduced uncertainty.
Makers: Retain JIT protections and earn rewards.
Protocols: Greater liquidity visibility, trading volume, and trust.
Composability: Works across protocols and asset pools; integrates with public DLOBs and CLOBs.
Integration & Composability
DROC and Vault contracts are designed for easy integration with any Solana (or similar L1/L2) protocol supporting DLOB, JIT, or CLOB architectures.
Collateral options and rewards adapt to protocol governance (DRIFT, $JTO, etc.).
Vault and DROC contracts support external yield sources for deeper liquidity.
Governance & Emergency Framework
Dynamic, protocol-led parameters for rewards, collateral, and emergency changes.
Security Council model for rapid response to market events, with DAO ratification.
Implementation Plan
Smart Contracts: Anchor-based programs for DROC and Vault, supporting multiple assets and oracle integration.
UI: Orderbook visualization and vault management for users and makers.
Testing: Devnet/mainnet deployment and integration with protocol-specific pools and governance.
Developer Access & Customization
All smart contract code and integration guides are available in this repository. Protocol teams can fork, customize, and adapt DROC and the vault for their own asset pools, reward models, and governance systems.
