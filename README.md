# Resting Liquidity Transparency
Hey, I’m [Moonbags], and I’m fed up with DeFi’s hidden liquidity—like Drift’s JIT model. My fix? **DROC**: on-chain, collateral-backed orders (0.01 SOL or JitoSOL) you can actually see. Plus a **Resting Liquidity Vault** where users toss in assets, boost liquidity, and earn DRIFT or $JTO. 

- `docs/proposal.md`: The big picture—mechanics, rewards, why it’s better.
- `contracts/`: Code for DROC, vault, rewards—dig in!
- `tests/`: Backtest results showing it works in bull/bear markets.

Feedback, collabs, whatever—hit me up on X (@[SHA 256) or Moonbags @Discord
